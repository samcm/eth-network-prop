# Network Data Availability Analysis

This project uses pre-generated Parquet files. PM me if you need them. Once you have them, place them in the `data` directory and run the app.

```bash
# Uses pre-generated Parquet files. 
./run.sh
```

A live version of the app is available at https://ultrasound-data-prop-analysis.streamlit.app/.
